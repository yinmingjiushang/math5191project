# Frank-Wolfe Algorithm

This project explores the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm and its applications in convex optimization, with a focus on its limitations when applied to high-degree polynomial optimization problems.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the main source code files for implementing and analyzing the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
  - `frank_wolfe_algorithm.py` - Implements the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and demonstrates its use in solving convex optimization problems.
  - `frank_wolfe_limitations_example.py` - Provides a counterexample using a high-degree polynomial to illustrate the limitations of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in non-convex settings.
  
- `out/` - Stores output files, such as plots or visualizations generated by the code.
  - `frank_wolfe.png` - Visual representation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithmâ€™s convergence.
  - `frank_wolfe_limitation.png` - Visualization showing the limitation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm on high-degree polynomial optimization.
